      <h1 class="headline">The Numbers Behind the Paradox</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Numbers aren't just numbers—they represent lives. In the Philippines, the coexistence of malnutrition and obesity reveals deep-rooted inequities in access to nutritious food. These statistics—from stunting in children to obesity in adults—illustrate how food insecurity manifests in dual health burdens.

      <h2>National Overview (2023 FNRI & DOH Data)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adult Obesity:</strong> Approximately 4 in every 10 Filipino adults (39.8%) are classified as obese, with prevalence significantly higher among women (45.4%) and urban residents (44.5%).</li>
        <li><strong>Household Food Insecurity:</strong> Roughly 31.4% of households experience moderate to severe food insecurity, while 2.7% face severe food insecurity.</li>
        <li><strong>Child Stunting:</strong> Around 23.6% of children under 5 years are stunted, and 15.1% are underweight.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Age Group Breakdown</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Children (5–10 years):</strong> About 14% are overweight or obese.</li>
        <li><strong>Adolescents (10–19 years):</strong> Approximately 13% are overweight or obese.</li>
        <li><strong>Adults (20+ years):</strong> Overweight or obesity rates hit 40.2% in total adult population.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Regional & Urban-Rural Disparities</h2>
      <h3>Metro Manila (Adults 20–59 years):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Overweight: 28.8%</li>
        <li>Obese: 9.6%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Among elderly Filipinos (60+): 24.7% overweight, 6.3% obese. Cities in NCR report even higher rates—up to 14% obesity among seniors.</p>

      <h3>Regional Hotspots in Child Stunting:</h3>
      <p>BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao) exhibits the highest stunting prevalence at 34.3%, one of the highest in the country.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Historical & Global Context</h2>
      <p>Over time, one in three Filipino children under age five was stunted—29% in 2019, with only slight improvement since 2008 (from 32%).</p>
      <p>The World Bank ranks the Philippines among the top 10 countries globally for stunting prevalence—underscoring its persistent nutritional challenge.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Overlap: Hidden Hunger</h2>
      <p>Many Filipinos face a paradox where they are overweight yet nutritionally deficient—so-called “hidden hunger.” Diets heavy in processed and calorie-dense food often lack essential vitamins and minerals, particularly among low-income populations.</p>
